<!-- 
⏳ Throttling in JavaScript
🔹 What is Throttling?
Throttling is a technique that ensures a function executes at most once in a fixed time interval, even if the event occurs multiple times.

Unlike debouncing, which delays execution until inactivity, throttling ensures periodic execution.

💡 Why Use Throttling?
🔹 Prevents excessive function calls (e.g., limiting API requests).
🔹 Improves performance by reducing unnecessary executions.
🔹 Ensures responsiveness while still handling frequent events.
