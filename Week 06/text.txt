Week 6 -------------------------
Objects - correct definition in js would be not collection of key value pairs, but it would be a real world entity that has properties(attributes) and behaviour/methods(actions/functions)

Class, Object, new, constructor(default & parameterized), __proto__ & Array.prototype(arr.__proto__ === Array.prototype)

Prototype chaining/inheritance

Note: In Js Every thing is an Object
Also prototypes are for internal working never touch it

extends keyword

2nd Class ----
arrow function, function declaration, function expression, Function.prototype .... this.name
First class functions (functions ko normal variable ke tarah treat kiya jaa raha hai)
